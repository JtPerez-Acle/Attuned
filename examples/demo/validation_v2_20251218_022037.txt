  SUMMARY & INTERPRETATION
==========================================================================

  API calls made: 180
  Estimated cost: ~$0.04 (gpt-4o-mini @ ~$0.15/1M input)

  What Attuned's RuleTranslator produces:
    - Base guidelines (ALWAYS): 3 rules about suggestions/drafts/silence
    - Conditional guidelines: Triggered when axis > 0.7 or < 0.3
    - Tone: warmth × formality → 'warm-casual', 'neutral-formal', etc.
    - Verbosity: 'brief' (< 0.3), 'balanced', 'comprehensive' (> 0.7)

  Statistical interpretation:
    p < 0.05: Statistically significant
    Effect: negligible (<0.2), small (0.2-0.5), medium (0.5-0.8), large (>0.8)
    ✓ PASS = significant + correct direction
    ✗ FAIL = significant + wrong direction
    ~ NS   = not statistically significant

  Conclusions:
    - H1 (Verbosity): Does 'Verbosity: brief/comprehensive' control length?
    - H2 (Tone): Does 'Tone: warm-casual/neutral-formal' affect language?
    - H3 (Anxiety): Does the anxiety guideline trigger reassurance?
    - H4 (Cognitive): Does cognitive load guideline reduce complexity?
    - H5 (Base): Do base guidelines alone change behavior vs no context?
    - H6 (Combined): Do multiple conditions work together correctly?
