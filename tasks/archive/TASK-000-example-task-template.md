## Task Description
This is an example task demonstrating the format for task documentation in our agentic development workflow. This template should be used as a reference when creating new tasks.

## Requirements
1. Understand the task file format
2. Create clear, actionable task descriptions
3. Include all necessary context for AI agents
4. Update status and progress regularly

## Research & Context
- Task files enable continuity across Claude Code sessions
- Each task is self-contained with all necessary information
- The format is optimized for AI agent comprehension
- Tasks can be discovered and managed programmatically

## Implementation Notes
- Copy this template when creating new tasks
- Replace all placeholder content with actual task details
- Use descriptive filenames following the naming convention
- Archive completed tasks to maintain a clean workspace
