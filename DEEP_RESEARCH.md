Linguistic Markers of Psychological State – Validation Evidence
Cognitive Load
Evidence Strength: Moderate. There is some empirical support that language complexity and fluency change under cognitive load, but findings are mixed. Classic cognitive psychology studies show that when working memory is taxed, people produce simpler sentences with more pauses or errors

mdpi.com
. For example, in deception research (where lying increases cognitive load), liars often exhibit reduced linguistic complexity unless they consciously compensate
mdpi.com
. Overall, evidence for reliably inferring cognitive load from static text alone is moderate at best. Key Supporting Papers: Studies in forensic linguistics and psycholinguistics provide clues. Gullberg et al. (2024) demonstrated that heightened cognitive load (induced by lying) manifests in language production as more pauses, hesitations, and revisions
mdpi.com
. Another model test by Vrij et al. (2018) found that liars under high load tended to reduce syntactic complexity, though liars can strategically adjust complexity if motivated
mdpi.com
. Working memory experiments also indicate that adding a secondary task (load) leads to simpler sentence structures and more disfluencies, supporting this link (e.g. Barkaoui 2019; Feng & Guo 2022 in writing research). Recommended Linguistic Markers: Features like sentence complexity (e.g. shorter sentences, fewer subordinate clauses), word/syllable length, and readability scores (e.g. Flesch-Kincaid grade) are reasonable proxies for cognitive effort. Markers of real-time difficulty – pauses, self-corrections, repetitions – strongly indicate cognitive load
mdpi.com
, though these are more evident in spoken or typed keystroke logs than in final edited text. Simpler vocabulary and frequent filler words might also suggest an overloaded speaker. These features have some empirical backing as reflective of cognitive strain during language production. Caveats: Context matters greatly. An individual’s baseline writing style affects what “complex” looks like – a normally verbose writer simplifying their language may signal load, but a terse writer might always use simple sentences. Real-time markers (pauses, typos, slower typing) are often needed; final text alone can miss these. Moreover, strategic behavior can mask cognitive load
mdpi.com
 – e.g. a liar might script a complex story in advance. Cognitive load indicators are also not unique – fatigue, time pressure, or low education could likewise simplify language. Thus, purely textual inference of cognitive load is prone to false positives without additional signals (like response time or error rates). Calibration Data Sources: There is no large off-the-shelf “cognitive load text” corpus, so validation may require controlled data. Experimental datasets where participants perform high vs. low load writing tasks and provide text could be used. For instance, deception narrative corpora (with truthful vs. lying conditions) include cognitive-load differences
mdpi.com
. Keystroke-logging datasets (e.g. in writing research) with pause annotations can serve as ground truth for load. Absent public datasets, one approach is to collect in-house data: ask users to write emails while multitasking (high load) versus focused (low load) and measure our features. Experience Sampling Method (ESM) studies could also help – e.g. have users report their mental effort and log their messages throughout the day
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. These would allow us to correlate our complexity metrics with self-rated cognitive load.
Anxiety/Stress
Evidence Strength: Moderate to Strong. A substantial body of work links linguistic patterns to anxiety, stress, and related affective states. Many findings are correlational (with small-to-moderate effect sizes), but they are consistent across studies. For instance, people feeling anxious or uncertain often use tentative language (“maybe”, “perhaps”) and other hedging expressions at higher rates
cs.cmu.edu
. Stressed individuals tend to use more negative emotion words and first-person singular pronouns (reflecting self-focus), according to classic studies of trauma writing
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Overall, linguistic cues of anxiety/stress have moderate predictive power – better than chance and often significant, but not so strong as to stand alone without context. Key Supporting Papers: Pennebaker’s research using LIWC has repeatedly shown reliable associations. For example, Cohn et al. (2004) analyzed thousands of diary entries around 9/11 and found that during high-stress periods, writers used more negative emotion words and more cognitive-process words (suggesting worry and processing)
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Tausczik & Pennebaker (2010) note that tentative words (“guess, perhaps”) increase when people feel uncertain or insecure
cs.cmu.edu
. A recent study by Rook et al. (2022) focused on Generalized Anxiety Disorder and showed that anxious individuals’ writings contained significantly more negations and negatively valenced emotion words, as well as more references to other people (social processes)
frontiersin.org
. In that study, just the density of negative emotion words was a strong indicator of high anxiety levels
frontiersin.org
. These peer-reviewed findings lend credence to our chosen markers for anxiety. Recommended Linguistic Markers: Hedge words and uncertainty markers are a key feature – frequent use of “maybe”, “perhaps”, “I guess”, etc., often signals anxiety or low confidence
cs.cmu.edu
. Question density (asking many questions or sounding unsure) can indicate rumination or anxious uncertainty. High usage of negative emotion vocabulary (e.g. “worried”, “afraid”, “nervous”) is a direct indicator – LIWC’s “Anxiety” category dictionary captures such terms. Other markers include first-person singular pronouns (“I”, “me”) which often rise with distress or self-focus, and absolutist words (“always”, “never”) which research has linked to anxious and depressed thinking styles. Our inclusion of these features is well-aligned with the literature – for example, one study found that anxious texts had more negations and negative words about stressors
frontiersin.org
. These markers, especially in combination, have empirical support as an anxiety/stress linguistic signature. Caveats: Language signals of stress are context-dependent and person-dependent. Not everyone verbalizes anxiety the same way – e.g. some may become more terse (fewer words) under stress, which could look like reduced hedge-word use. Cultural communication norms also play a role: in some cultures, using tentative language is a politeness strategy unrelated to internal anxiety
sciencedirect.com
. Sarcasm or humor can confound analysis – an anxious person might say “I’m totally fine 😬” using positive or extreme words counterintuitively. Additionally, increased question marks or hedging could sometimes reflect a polite or analytical style rather than stress. The effect sizes, while significant, are often modest (correlations in the r=0.2–0.3 range). This means many anxious individuals won’t fit the stereotype and many non-anxious texts contain hedges. In practice, a model should combine multiple signals and possibly individual baselines to avoid false positives (e.g. someone who always hedges vs. someone who only hedges when stressed). Calibration Data Sources: There are several useful datasets. Dreaddit (Turcan & McKeown 2019) is a public Reddit corpus for stress detection with 3.5K human-labeled segments
aclanthology.org
aclanthology.org
 (posts labeled as “stressed” vs “not stressed”), which can validate our anxiety features. Similarly, the CLPsych shared tasks have provided Reddit and Twitter data labeled for mental health signals (including anxiety, stress, and depression). For clinically grounded data, some studies have collected expressive writing samples with anxiety measures – e.g. Rook et al. (2022) had participants write about an anxious experience and recorded their GAD questionnaire scores
frontiersin.org
. Those narratives (possibly available via the authors) could help tune our model. We can also leverage mental health forum datasets (e.g. posts from r/Anxiety vs r/Happy or Eustress forums) to see if our markers differentiate them. In terms of ground truth methodology, many use self-report surveys (like DASS for stress, GAD-7 for anxiety) administered alongside text collection, or experience sampling (prompting users to report mood and stress throughout the day via an app). These methods provide labels to empirically validate which linguistic cues actually predict the person’s reported anxiety/stress.
Urgency
Evidence Strength: Moderate (in specific contexts). The link between certain linguistic features and a sense of urgency is recognized in domains like persuasive communication and emergency messaging, but academic literature is relatively sparse compared to other axes. Nonetheless, time-related keywords (“ASAP”, “immediately”, “urgent”), imperative commands, and a heightened use of exclamation points are widely regarded as signals of urgency. For example, cybersecurity research on phishing emails has empirically confirmed that “urgency cues” are a dominant strategy scammers use to prompt quick action
researchgate.net
. Overall, there is moderate evidence that these cues correlate with an urgent or pressing psychological state (or at least an attempt to convey urgency). Key Supporting Papers: In social engineering and communication studies, urgency markers have been studied as persuasive triggers. Workman (2007) and subsequent phishing studies show that fraudulent emails often exploit urgent language to short-circuit rational thinking
researchgate.net
. Naidoo (2014) analyzed phishing scam designs and found urgent wording and time pressure (“immediately verify your account or it will be closed!”) was the most commonly used tactic to induce compliance
researchgate.net
. This not only demonstrates that writers intentionally use these markers to signal urgency, but also that readers perceive them and react. Outside of phishing, pragmatics research notes that exclamation points can convey urgency or intensity; a recent social psychology experiment found that in professional emails, using “!” made the message seem more panicked or urgent compared to a similar message with a period
phys.org
. These studies collectively support the idea that certain words and punctuation create a sense of urgency in text. Recommended Linguistic Markers: Our chosen markers align with common findings. Urgency words like “ASAP”, “urgent”, “immediately”, “now” explicitly convey time pressure – these should be weighted highly. Imperative sentences (commands) without mitigating politeness (e.g. “Submit the report by 5.”) often indicate urgency or authority. Exclamation marks are another indicator: while they can simply show excitement, in many contexts an exclamation mark (or a series like “!!!”) adds a tone of urgency or alarm
phys.org
. Capitalization or red-flag phrases (“ACT NOW!”, “last chance”) similarly serve as urgency cues. We recommend focusing on (a) the presence of these urgency keywords/phrases, (b) high use of exclamation points, all-caps, or other emphasis, and (c) abrupt, direct syntax (telegraphic commands), which together suggest the message’s sender feels something is time-critical. Caveats: False signals are a concern. Exuberance or enthusiasm can be mistaken for urgency – e.g. “I can’t wait!!!” has exclamation points but no true time pressure. Conversely, someone can convey urgency without obvious markers, relying on context (“Please, I need this done”). So our system might miss urgent situations that aren’t explicitly labeled as such. Cultural and individual differences matter too: some people habitually use exclamation points (or all-caps) for emphasis, not strictly urgency. In a formal context, an exclamation might be seen as urgency or aggression
phys.org
, but in informal texting, it could just denote excitement. Additionally, imperatives can serve many functions (requests, advice) not all of which imply urgency. We should also be careful that detecting urgency words in a message doesn’t necessarily mean the writer’s psychological state is urgent – it might be a situational urgency being described. In short, these cues should be interpreted with context. The evidence is sufficient to use them, but the system should treat them as possible red flags rather than definitive proof of an urgent mental state. Calibration Data Sources: No single benchmark dataset focuses on “urgency in text,” but we can draw on related resources. For example, email datasets (Enron or customer support tickets) that have priority or “urgent” labels can provide training examples – some research has done email intent classification where urgent vs. non-urgent is a category. Incident reports or crisis message corpora (e.g. disaster relief tweets tagged with “urgent” needs) could also be repurposed. One available resource is a voicemail urgency detection dataset used in experiments (e.g. a 2018 paper on classifying urgent vs. non-urgent voicemails). Furthermore, phishing email corpora (though domain-specific) contain plenty of urgent-language examples – these could help validate that our “urgency word” feature set indeed distinguishes urgent-sounding messages
researchgate.net
. In the absence of a dedicated dataset, we might create a small annotation project: take a sample of emails or chats and have humans label whether they sense urgency. This could serve as ground truth to finetune thresholds for our urgency features (and determine a reasonable “minimum sample size” of urgent messages needed to calibrate the model’s sensitivity).
Formality
Evidence Strength: Strong. Linguistic markers of formality vs. informality are well-documented in sociolinguistics and NLP, and their correlations with context and tone are robust. Unlike a psychological state, formality is more of a style/register indicator, but it does reflect underlying factors like social distance or professionalism. Research consistently shows, for instance, that contractions (e.g. “don’t” vs “do not”) are used far less in formal writing, while polite phrases and titles are used more
revistaiberica.org
. Studies on emails and transcripts have quantified these differences. Therefore, there is strong evidence that features like contraction rate, slang, and politeness markers reliably signal formality level. Key Supporting Papers: Many corpus studies confirm these patterns. Heylighen & Dewaele (2002) proposed a formality score based on pronoun vs. noun usage, validating it on various texts. An analysis of academic vs. personal emails by Pavlik et al. (2014) found that formal emails had almost zero contractions and used more elaborate greetings/closings, whereas informal emails showed the opposite (frequent “I’m, you’re”, emoticons, etc.)
revistaiberica.org
. A study in Ibérica (2010) specifically examined email communication and noted clear markers: formal messages had standard greetings (“Dear Dr. X”), fewer contractions, and more polite requests, while informal ones had colloquial tone, first names, and even non-standard spellings
revistaiberica.org
. LIWC’s analytic vs. informal tone metrics also capture some of this: higher use of Netspeak, swear words, and fillers indicates informality, whereas references to social niceties and longer words indicate formality. Collectively, these works give us high confidence in the linguistic indicators of formality. Recommended Linguistic Markers: We focus on features known to distinguish a formal register. The contraction ratio is a straightforward one: formal writing tends to avoid contractions (“cannot” vs “can’t”)
revistaiberica.org
. Use of slang or Netspeak (like “lol, btw”) and emoticons/emoji are strong informality signals. Politeness markers are indicative of formality: phrases like “please,” “thank you,” honorifics (“Sir, Ma’am, Dr.”) suggest a formal, respectful tone. Sentence complexity and length can also play a role – formal writing often uses more complex sentence structures and richer vocabulary (multisyllabic words) compared to informal conversation. Our feature set already includes some of these (complexity under cognitive load, which overlaps with formality to a degree). Additionally, formality correlates with pronoun usage: formal texts use more third person or impersonal constructions (“the user”) whereas informal ones use more first/second person (“I” and “you”). In summary, the recommended markers are: Contraction frequency (inversely), slang/abbreviation presence, politeness phrases, greetings and sign-offs, and general lexical sophistication. These have empirical support as reliable indicators of formality. Caveats: One challenge is that formality isn’t a binary – it’s a spectrum, and certain markers may conflict. For example, a text could be polite but still informal (e.g. “Please send me the info ASAP, thanks!” has “please/thanks” but also slang “info” and all-caps ASAP). Our model will need to balance such features. Domain differences are important: a technical report vs. a casual forum post differ greatly, but even two formal contexts (legal vs. academic writing) have their own jargon. Cultural differences also exist in what is considered formal. For instance, Japanese formal writing avoids first-person pronouns far more than English formal writing due to cultural norms. We should be aware that our features are tuned to (primarily) English norms. Another caveat: formality indicators can be mimicked – someone might deliberately use formal language to appear polite (without actually feeling respectful). Since formality is more stylistic, it’s less about the author’s internal state and more about external context (audience, setting). This means using formality alone to infer something like the person’s mood or sincerity can be misleading. Nonetheless, as a dimension in our system, it’s useful for tone adjustment or detecting if a message is out-of-place (e.g. overly formal or too casual for a given context). Calibration Data Sources: We have plenty of data to calibrate formality detection. The Enron email corpus is one (it contains both professional emails and some casual exchanges). We could label a sample of Enron emails for perceived formality and check our feature correlation. Another resource is the GYAFC (Grammarly’s Yelp Formality Corpus), which has sentences rewritten from informal to formal style – useful for validating that our markers increase in the formal versions. Additionally, many academic vs. social media text comparisons exist (e.g. Reddit comments vs. journal articles). For a quick calibration, we might take a Wikipedia article (very formal) and compare it to an equivalent Reddit discussion (very informal) to ensure our features correctly differentiate them. Public datasets from formality-style transfer research or any corpus with register annotation (such as Switchboard transcripts labeled by formality or the aforementioned Ibérica study data) would be helpful. Fortunately, because formality is easy to recognize, even a small curated sample (a few dozen messages labeled “formal” or “informal” by human raters) could be enough to tune thresholds for features like contraction rate or slang count – the signal-to-noise ratio is high for these markers.
Emotional Intensity
Evidence Strength: Strong. There is clear evidence that certain linguistic cues correspond to the intensity of emotion expressed in text. These cues – such as exclamation marks, all-caps, repeated letters, and extreme emotion words – have been studied in communication and psycholinguistics and found to amplify perceived emotional intensity. Unlike simply detecting positive vs. negative sentiment, intensity markers indicate how strongly an emotion is felt. Research in computer-mediated communication supports our feature choices: using multiple exclamation points or all capital letters is akin to shouting or high excitement, and readers consistently interpret it as such
nature.com
. Overall, the evidence is strong that these textual features are valid indicators of emotional intensity (high arousal states). Key Supporting Papers: A 2023 perspective in Communications Psychology explicitly noted that typographic choices like “!” and ALL CAPS are textual correlates of prosody (intonation and stress) that increase perceived emotional intensity
nature.com
. This aligns with studies of online discourse: e.g., Kalman & Gergle (2014) found that messages in all-caps were rated as more intense or “loud.” Huang et al. (2021) examined “emotive amplifiers” on Twitter and confirmed that lengthening words (sooooo happy) or adding punctuation (!!!) reliably signal stronger emotion. Additionally, work on negatively valenced expressions has noted that people use intensified language (all caps, profanity, multiple exclamations) to convey extreme anger or frustration
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. These findings across multiple studies reinforce that our chosen markers are valid for capturing emotional intensity. Recommended Linguistic Markers: We will use a combination of orthographic cues and lexical cues. Key orthographic markers are exclamation points – e.g. “I’m excited!!!” versus “I’m excited.” – the former clearly conveys higher excitement. Similarly, ALL CAPS (or capitalizing words that aren’t normally capitalized) is widely understood as either shouting or emphasis, indicating strong emotion
nature.com
. Multiple repeated punctuation or letters (e.g. “nooooo!!”) also serve as intensity signals. On the lexical side, the presence of emotionally charged words (especially superlatives or strong adjectives) matters – compare “upset” vs. “devastated,” or “good” vs. “absolutely fantastic.” We will leverage sentiment lexicons that score words by intensity. Another marker can be swear words, as people often swear to emphasize extreme feelings (positive or negative). In sum, our feature set for intensity includes: exclamation count, all-caps frequency, elongated words, and an “emotional tone” score that weights stronger emotion words higher. All are backed by research; for example, using all caps and exclamations has been likened to adding vocal stress, thereby amplifying the emotional tone of the message
nature.com
. Caveats: These markers are generally clear, but nuance is needed in interpretation. Not every exclamation mark means intense emotion – some people use “!!” habitually. Conversely, someone might be seething with anger yet write a very controlled message (no caps or exclamation, perhaps for professionalism). So absence of markers doesn’t guarantee lack of emotion, it might indicate restraint or a different communication style. Irony and sarcasm can also muddle things: e.g. “Oh GREAT!!!” with exclamations might be sarcastic rather than genuinely intense positive emotion. Our model should consider context to avoid misinterpreting sarcastic intensity (which is actually a negative sentiment). Additionally, the type of emotion matters – high intensity could be joy or rage or panic, which have different implications. We are only measuring intensity here, but downstream one might want to combine intensity with sentiment detection. Finally, cultural differences in written expression exist (e.g. Spanish and Italian writing often uses more exclamation marks as a norm, possibly requiring different baselines). Despite these caveats, intensity markers are fairly straightforward; we just must use them as indicators of expressed intensity, not necessarily internal felt intensity (though the two are usually correlated). Calibration Data Sources: We can validate emotional intensity features against existing sentiment/emotion datasets. For example, the Emoji/Emoticon datasets (which often include multiple “!” as features) can be used – many Twitter corpora label tweets for sentiment strength (strong positive/negative). The NRC Emotion Intensity dataset (Mohammad et al. 2018) provides human ratings of emotion intensity for a set of tweets, which would be ideal for checking if our features align with high vs. low intensity categories. We might also use crowd-sourced data: show annotators pairs of messages differing by punctuation (e.g. “I love it.” vs “I LOVE it!!!”) to ensure they perceive the latter as more intense – this would validate our assumption qualitatively. In practice, unsupervised calibration is possible: we could scan a large social media corpus for messages with extreme punctuation and verify they co-occur with words like “soooo, really, extremely” and strong emotion words. Finally, LIWC’s “Emotional tone” output might be compared to our intensity metric on a sample of texts to see if we’re capturing similar variance. Since intensity is often domain-specific, we may also calibrate by context (a single “!” in an official report is extremely intense for that genre, whereas on Instagram five “!” is common). So calibration may involve different thresholds for different contexts, informed by data from each.
Assertiveness
Evidence Strength: Moderate. Assertiveness (and its converse, hedging or uncertainty) in language has been studied in psychology and communications. There is moderate evidence that certain linguistic features correlate with being perceived as assertive, confident, or dominant. For example, using fewer hedges and more certainty words has been linked to higher ratings of confidence
journals.librarypublishing.arizona.edu
. Likewise, speaking in direct commands or statements (as opposed to questions or tentative suggestions) tends to come across as more assertive. The evidence comes from personality-language correlation studies and analyses of leadership communication. It’s not as extensively quantified as, say, LIWC affect categories, but multiple studies support our assumptions, so we deem it moderate reliability. Key Supporting Papers: An early study by Gill and Oberlander (2006) on personality found that people described as confident used more “certainty words” like definitely, absolutely and fewer tentative phrases. A notable finding by Greve & Funder (2006) was that use of certainty-related words (e.g. “sure”, “guarantee”, “definitely”) correlated with others perceiving the speaker as confident and intelligent
journals.librarypublishing.arizona.edu
. Kacewicz et al. (2014) introduced the concept of a linguistic “Clout” score (now part of LIWC2015), which algorithmically captures social dominance in language – higher Clout writers tend to use more authoritative, confident language (more “we” vs “I”, more assertions)
researchgate.net
. They found measurable differences: higher-status individuals use more confident phrasing (with a medium effect size, d≈0.4) compared to lower-status individuals who use more self-doubt or hedges
researchgate.net
. These works give credence that our features (hedging vs. certainty, etc.) indeed map onto assertiveness. Recommended Linguistic Markers: Certainty markers are key. Words and phrases that convey conviction – definitely, clearly, of course, in fact – signal that the speaker is stating something with authority. We will track the frequency of such terms (LIWC has a “Certainty” category in fact). Conversely, a low frequency of hedge words (few “maybe, I think, sort of”) suggests higher assertiveness (since hedging undermines forcefulness). The use of imperative verbs can indicate assertiveness too (as it takes a commanding tone), though if overused it might cross into aggression. Pronoun usage can also hint at confidence: high-status/assertive individuals often say “we” or speak in declarations rather than saying “I think…” (which can imply personal uncertainty). LIWC’s “Clout” metric, which combines several such signals, is essentially a measure of assertive vs. humble style; if available to us, it’s worth considering. Additionally, absence of question marks in a context where one might expect questions could indicate a more declarative (assertive) approach. In summary, our assertiveness features should include: counts of certainty words, counts of hedges (inversely), use of direct statements/imperatives, and perhaps indicators of confidence like absence of first-person singular pronouns (since constantly saying “I feel/I guess” can soften assertions). These are borne out by research – certainty word use has indeed been associated with perceptions of confidence
journals.librarypublishing.arizona.edu
. Caveats: Politeness and culture intersect with assertiveness. In some settings, being very direct can be seen as rude rather than appropriately confident, so speakers (especially in collectivist cultures or high-context cultures) often temper assertiveness with politeness strategies. This means a highly assertive person might still use hedges or polite modal verbs (“could you please…”) to be culturally appropriate – our system might misclassify that as less assertive when it’s more a style difference. Another caveat is distinguishing true internal confidence from linguistic posturing. Some writers use emphatic, absolute language habitually (or to persuade), but it doesn’t always reflect their actual certainty. Also, context plays a role: in a brainstorming email, even confident people might hedge to appear open to ideas, whereas in a proposal they assert more. There’s also a potential gender difference noted in literature – e.g. some studies find women use more hedges in mixed-gender settings (possibly due to social conditioning), which doesn’t necessarily mean they are less sure of their ideas. Thus our assertiveness inference should be taken as perceived assertiveness. Finally, note that overuse of certainty words and imperatives can signal arrogance or anger rather than healthy assertiveness, so there’s a nonlinear aspect – moderate usage conveys confidence, extreme usage might flip perception negatively. These nuances mean our features need calibration to context and perhaps personalization. Calibration Data Sources: We can validate assertiveness markers using datasets from personality prediction and leadership communication. For instance, the Emergent Leadership Corpus (if available) or any collection of meeting transcripts where leaders vs. followers speak could be informative – do leaders show higher counts of our assertive markers? Also, the Personality Assessment Corpus (Pennebaker & King, 1999) correlated word use with traits like extraversion and dominance; their results (available in the LIWC literature) can guide weighting of features. We might also use crowd-annotated data: sample sentences and have people rate how assertive vs. tentative the speaker seems, then check if our feature values correlate with those ratings. Another path is to analyze online forums: e.g. StackExchange comments (often direct) vs. interpersonal support forums (more hedging) to see if the differences align with assertiveness expectations. In terms of available tools, Receptiviti API (a commercial tool built on LIWC) offers an “Assertiveness” score based on similar features; while we may not use it, their white papers could provide validation information and benchmarks. Overall, a small custom dataset might suffice – e.g. 100 sentences labeled for assertive vs. non-assertive tone – to ensure our certainty/hedge features are firing correctly. Because assertiveness is somewhat subjective, having human judgments in the loop for calibration is especially helpful (this addresses the “ground truth” of how our model’s output aligns with what people perceive as assertive communication).
Summary and Recommendations
Feasibility of Inference: Based on the evidence, some axes are more readily inferred from text than others. Emotional intensity and formality are the most feasible – their markers (punctuation, caps, vocabulary choice) are quite overt and consistently meaningful, so our system can detect these with reasonable accuracy using simple rules or learned thresholds. Assertiveness and anxiety/stress are moderately feasible: there are known linguistic cues, but they benefit from more context and individual calibration. We can still achieve useful accuracy by combining multiple features (e.g. hedging + negative emotion + self-reference for anxiety) – indeed, prior NLP models have had success detecting depression/anxiety from language, though with some false positives. Urgency and cognitive load are more challenging from text alone. Urgency sometimes will be obvious (“URGENT: ...!!!”), but in many cases it might require situational knowledge (is there a deadline or danger?). Cognitive load is perhaps the least directly inferable purely via text content – often one needs timing, pauses, or errors to gauge it. In general, axes tied to writing style and emotion (formality, intensity, sentiment) are easier than those tied to internal cognitive state or external context (load, true urgency). Need for Other Signals: For certain dimensions, incorporating extra-linguistic signals is advisable. Cognitive load would likely require behavioral signals (e.g. typing speed, pause lengths, physiological measures like pupil dilation) to accurately assess – textual complexity alone is an imperfect proxy. Anxiety/stress could be corroborated with biometric data (heart rate, etc.) or user self-reports, since language might only tell part of the story (some highly anxious people don’t use anxious words, and vice versa). Urgency can often be better judged with context: for example, a message like “please respond” is only urgent if we know it’s near a deadline – calendar info or metadata could help. Even assertiveness might be refined by considering audio tone in spoken contexts or response patterns in dialogue (does the person dominate the conversation?). So, we recommend treating our text-based inference as one layer and, when possible, integrating other signals or asking the user for feedback on critical inferences. Accuracy of Modern Approaches: Notably, recent transformer-based NLP models (BERT, GPT, etc.) can often pick up subtle combinations of linguistic cues that correlate with psychological states. They have achieved strong results on related tasks (e.g. >90% F1 in some mental health classification challenges
arxiv.org
), suggesting that deeper patterns (like irony or context-dependent usage) can be learned. However, these models are less interpretable. Interestingly, one 2024 study found that fine-tuned large language models did not always outperform a simpler feature-based SVM for depression/anxiety classification in therapy transcripts
arxiv.org
, indicating that with limited or specialized data, classical linguistic features remain competitive. Our hybrid approach (using empirically supported features) is thus justified for interpretability and likely sufficient for a first-pass system. We can later explore using embeddings or transformer models to see if they boost accuracy beyond what these features achieve. The accuracy gap between simple features and deep learning may vary by axis: e.g., for sentiment/emotion, deep models shine by catching sarcasm and context, while for formality, a simple rule-based classifier might be just as good. We should keep an eye on state-of-the-art results (for instance, CLPsych shared task outcomes) to calibrate our expectations. As of 2025, many research efforts combine lexicon features (like LIWC categories) with deep learning to get the benefits of both – we might consider the same if resources permit. Validation and Next Steps: To ensure our mappings are sound, we should conduct validation studies for each axis. Concretely:
Pilot Annotation Study: Gather a set of example texts and have human judges rate them on each of the six axes. This will give us a small “ground truth” to see if our feature-derived scores align with human perception. This is especially useful for subjective axes like assertiveness or urgency.
Leverage Public Datasets: As detailed above, use datasets like Dreaddit (stress), JEMO/NRC (emotion intensity), formality corpora, etc., to quantitatively evaluate our feature-based classifiers. We should document the effect sizes we observe (e.g. does hedge-word frequency differ significantly between high-stress and low-stress texts in Dreaddit? by how much?).
Iterative Refinement: If some features show weak or no correlation in empirical tests, we should reconsider them. For instance, if our cognitive load features (sentence length, etc.) don’t actually differ in a controlled experiment, we might label that axis as “Weak evidence” or seek alternative cues.
Calibration in Deployment: Design the system with a feedback loop. For example, if the system infers a user is highly anxious, it could (in a low-stakes way) ask, “Feeling stressed?” and use the user’s response to adjust its confidence. Over time, this can personalize the model (perhaps the user always sounds anxious due to writing style, so the system learns to dial back). In customer service or mental health apps, ongoing calibration is done via periodic self-report check-ins or by monitoring outcomes (did an intervention occur, was the user satisfied, etc.). We should plan a similar mechanism to continually validate and improve our inferences.
Minimum Data for Reliability: From a practical standpoint, we should determine how much text is needed before we trust an inference. Likely, a single sentence can show emotional intensity (with an exclamation) but not give a stable read on formality or assertiveness (which might require a sample of writing). We might set a threshold like “require at least 100 words or 5 sentences before judging formality or cognitive load.” This is informed by reliability analyses – e.g., in personality linguistics, a few hundred words are needed for a stable signal
cs.cmu.edu
. We should use literature and some internal tests to set such minimums.
In conclusion, inferring psychological dimensions from text is partially feasible: style and affect are easier to detect accurately, whereas cognitive states and interpersonal stance require caution. Our plan is to ground each inference in well-validated linguistic features, use available data to verify them, and integrate feedback loops for continuous validation. This balanced approach will help ensure that when our system says “User seems anxious” or “Message sounds urgent,” it’s supported by empirical evidence and can be trusted as a meaningful insight rather than a wild guess. By combining established tools like LIWC (and its open equivalents)

 with modern NLP where appropriate, we aim to achieve a system that is both accurate in its detections and transparent about why it made them. Such a system will also delineate its limits – for axes where text alone is not enough, it can either refrain or explicitly flag low confidence, prompting either user input or integration of additional signals. This careful validation and calibration process is our next step toward a robust psychological state inference engine. Sources:
